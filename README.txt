Computational Vision Homework 2

1. All four parts of the assignment have been completed.
2. Some objects appear very dark due to the way sequential labeling occurs. 
3. All programs runs as directed in assignment details.
4. Input files same as the ones provided.

Program_1 Binary_Conversion:
    - The threshold value used for testing is 128

Program_2 Image_Labeling:
    - The first few objects that are labeled remain a very dark color since labeling begins at a gray level of 1 and increments upward.

Program_3 Computing of properties
    - Parameters for E_min (a, b, and c) are calculated by subtracting b(x,y) from the centroid following a preliminary raster scan.
    
Program_4 Object detection
    - The criteria used for matching objects are an area and roundedness that are within a 0% to 15% error range.
